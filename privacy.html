          <h2>Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect the minimum amount of information necessary to deliver the Spin Rewards Hub services and to comply
            with Google AdSense programme policies. Depending on how you interact with the site, this may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contact information that you voluntarily submit through support or consultation requests.</li>
            <li>Pseudonymous identifiers such as browser cookies, device attributes, and session IDs to maintain spin history.</li>

        <section class="legal-card" id="how-we-use-information">
          <h2>How we use information</h2>
          <p>
            Information is used to deliver the requested service and to ensure the integrity of the rewards programme. In
            practice this means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Running the spin experience, managing eligibility windows, and preventing abuse or duplicate entries.</li>
            <li>Responding to support enquiries, consultation requests, and compliance audits.</li>
            <li>Improving the quality of editorial content by analysing aggregate engagement trends.</li>
            <li>Measuring ad performance so that we can maintain an ad experience aligned with Google’s policies.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="legal-bases">
          <h2>Legal bases for processing</h2>
          <p>
            We rely on different legal bases depending on the data type and jurisdiction. These include consent for analytics
            and advertising cookies, legitimate interest when we monitor abuse prevention signals, and contractual necessity
            when you request consultancy or fulfilment support. Where required, we seek explicit consent before processing
            sensitive data or transferring information outside your region.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="cookies">
          <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies help us understand which resources are most helpful and allow AdSense to deliver relevant ads. You can
            reject non-essential cookies at any time using the consent banner or by adjusting your browser settings. We
            honour browser-level “Do Not Track” signals by limiting analytics collection and disabling personalised ads when
            the signal is present.
          </p>
          <p>
            When third-party partners provide measurement pixels or rewarded ad placements, they are contractually required
            to respect our cookie policies and to only process data needed to provide their service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="adsense">
          <h2>Advertising and AdSense</h2>
          <p>
            Spin Rewards Hub uses Google AdSense to monetise certain content areas. Ads load only after visitors grant
            consent, and all ad calls follow Google’s policies for inventory quality, prohibited content, and user privacy.
            We do not permit the serving of ads on pages that lack substantive editorial material or that are under
            construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google may use cookies and device identifiers to personalise ads. You can learn more about how Google handles
            data by visiting the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Privacy &amp; Terms</a> site. Visitors in the EEA and UK can access additional granular controls via
            the consent banner.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="data-retention">
          <h2>Data retention and security</h2>
          <p>
            Data is stored only for as long as necessary to deliver the service or to meet legal requirements. Spin activity
            logs are retained for up to 18 months, after which they are aggregated or deleted. Contact records are kept while
            your support ticket remains open. We use encryption in transit and at rest, limit access to authorised personnel,
            and conduct regular penetration tests to validate our safeguards.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="your-rights">
          <h2>Your privacy rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your personal data. You can
            exercise these rights by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@spinrewardshub.com">privacy@spinrewardshub.com</a> and
            providing sufficient information for us to verify your identity. We respond to all valid requests within one
            month unless a shorter timeframe is mandated by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. We encourage you to
            contact us first so we can address any concerns directly.

          <h2>International data transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Our infrastructure partners may process data in the United States, the European Union, or other regions where
            they operate. When data leaves its origin country, we apply safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and
            conduct risk assessments on the recipient vendor.
