        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe the rules that govern your use of the Spin Rewards Hub website, demo
          experience, and any associated consultation or support offerings. By using our site you agree to the Terms below.
        </p>
        <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: 5 June 2024</p>
      </section>

      <div class="legal-grid">
        <section class="legal-card" id="eligibility">
          <h2>Eligibility and accounts</h2>
          <p>
            The public demo can be accessed without creating an account. If you request private onboarding, you must provide
            accurate contact information and confirm that you are authorised to act on behalf of your organisation. We may
            decline or revoke access if we suspect unauthorised or unlawful activity.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="acceptable-use">
          <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to misuse the Spin Rewards Hub services. Prohibited activities include attempting to bypass the
            spin cooldown, scraping content without permission, reverse engineering our code, injecting malicious software,
            or interfering with other visitors’ enjoyment of the site. We reserve the right to block traffic that appears to
            violate AdSense or AdMob policies.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="content">
          <h2>Editorial content and ownership</h2>
          <p>
            All articles, guides, videos, and visual assets published on Spin Rewards Hub are protected by copyright and may
            not be republished without written consent. You may quote short excerpts with attribution and a link back to the
            original page. Custom strategy documents provided during consultancy engagements remain confidential.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="rewards">
          <h2>Rewards and promotions</h2>
          <p>
            Rewards showcased in the demo are illustrative. Any live promotions you run using our framework must include
            official rules, eligibility requirements, prize descriptions, and fulfilment timelines. You are responsible for
            complying with regional sweepstakes laws, tax obligations, and age restrictions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="ads">
          <h2>Advertising and monetisation</h2>
          <p>
            Our templates are designed to align with Google AdSense policies. When implementing them on your site, you must
            maintain substantial original content on every page, avoid deceptive layouts, and clearly label rewarded
            placements. We may revoke access to assets or documentation if we believe they are being used to support policy
            violations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="feedback">
          <h2>Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            If you share product ideas or recommendations, you grant Spin Rewards Hub a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence
            to use that feedback to improve the service. We may publish anonymised learnings or aggregate statistics unless
            you request otherwise in writing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="disclaimer">
          <h2>Warranty disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            Spin Rewards Hub is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. While we strive for accuracy, we do not
            guarantee that content will be error-free or that the site will be available at all times. Use of the demo or any
            downloadable resource is at your own risk.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="liability">
          <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, Spin Rewards Hub and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the site. Our total liability
            for any claim relating to the services is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the
            claim, if any.

        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="termination">
          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate access to the site or consultation services at our discretion, particularly when
            requested by regulators or when policy compliance is at risk. You may stop using the site at any time. Sections
            covering intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations of liability survive termination.

        </section>

        <section class="legal-card" id="governing-law">
          <h2>Governing law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes will
            be resolved in the courts of Dublin, unless another venue is required by mandatory consumer protection laws.

            changes will be announced on the home page and take effect no sooner than 14 days after posting. Your continued
            use of Spin Rewards Hub after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
